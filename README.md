*"Auditing human systems through nature's design principles"*

## 🔍 Overview

The KOSMOS Systems Auditor is a biomimetic framework for analyzing and scoring complex systems (economic, political, technological, or ecological) against nature's 3.8 billion years of evolutionary wisdom. It provides:

- **Quantitative metrics** comparing human systems to natural benchmarks
- **Collapse risk forecasting** via physics-inspired models
- **Biomimetic repair protocols** for failing systems

🌿 Core Frameworks
1. 7ES Structural Anatomy
Evaluates systems across 7 elements:

text
Input | Output | Processing | Controls 
Feedback | Interface | Environment
2. Designer Query Discriminator (DQD)
Measures design origins:

text
DQD = (Designer Traceability + Goal Alignment + Enforcement Dependency)/3
0-0.3: Emergent/Natural

0.4-0.6: Hybrid

0.7-1.0: Designed/Unnatural

3. Fundamental Design Principles (FDPs)
8 biomimetic metrics scored 0-10:

Symbiotic Purpose

Adaptive Resilience

Reciprocal Ethics

Closed-Loop Materiality

Distributed Agency

Contextual Harmony

Emergent Transparency

Intellectual Honesty

4. Observer's Collapse Function (OCF)
text
OCF = (Belief Dependence × Participation Dependency)/Stability
>0.6: High collapse risk
