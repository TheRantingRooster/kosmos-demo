*"Auditing human systems through nature's design principles"*

## 🔍 Overview

The KOSMOS Systems Auditor is a biomimetic framework for analyzing and scoring complex systems (economic, political, technological, or ecological) against nature's 3.8 billion years of evolutionary wisdom. It provides:

- **Quantitative metrics** comparing human systems to natural benchmarks
- **Collapse risk forecasting** via physics-inspired models
- **Biomimetic repair protocols** for failing systems
